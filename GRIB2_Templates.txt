; Notes:
; ( 1) Basic angle of the initial production domain and subdivisions of this basic angle are provided to manage cases where the recommended unit of 10-6 degrees is not applicable to describe the extreme longitudes and latitudes, and direction increments. For these last six descriptors, unit is equal to the ratio of the basic angle and the subdivisions number. For ordinary cases, zero and missing values should be coded, equivalent to respective values of 1 and 106 (10-6 degrees unit).
; ( 2) For data on a quasi-regular grid, where all the rows or columns do not necessarily have the same number of grid points, either Ni (Octets 31-34) or Nj (Octets 35-38) and the corresponding Di (Octets 64-67) or Dj (Octets 68-71) shall be coded with all bits set to 1 (missing). The actual number of points along each parallel or meridian shall be coded in the octets immediately following the Grid Definition Template (Octets [xx+1] - nn), as described in the description of the Grid Definition Section.
; ( 3) A quasi-regular grid is only defined for appropriate grid scanning modes. Either rows or columns, but not both simultaneously, may have variable numbers of points or variable spacing. The first point in each row (column) shall be positioned at the meridian (parallel) indicated by Octets 47-54. The grid points shall be evenly spaced in latitude (longitude).
; ( 4) A scaled value of radius of spherical Earth, or major or minor axis of oblate spheroid Earth is derived from applying appropriate scale factor to the value expressed in metres.
; ( 5) It is recommended to use unsigned direction increments
; ( 6) In most cases, multiplying Ni (octets 31–34) by Nj (octets 35–38) yields the total number of points in the grid. However, this may not be true if bit 8 of the scanning mode flags (octet 72) is set to 1

;      (b) The geographic longitude in degrees of the southern pole of the coordinate system, lambdap for example.
;      (c) The angle of rotation in degrees about the new polar axis (measured clockwise when looking from the southern to the northern pole) of the coordinate system, assuming the new axis to have been obtained by first rotating the sphere through lambdap degrees about the geographic polar axis, and then rotating through (90 + thetap) degrees so that the southern pole moved along the (previously rotated) Greenwich meridian.

;      (b) The longitude in degrees (measured in the model coordinate system) of the "pole of stretching"; and
;      (c) The stretching factor C in units of 10-6 represented as an integer. The stretching is defined by representing data uniformly in a coordinate system with longitude Y and latitude X1, where:

; and Y and X are longitude and latitude in a coordinate system in which the "pole of stretching" is the northern pole. C = 1 gives uniform resolution, while C > 1 give enhanced resolution around the pole of stretching.

; Notes:
; ( 1) Hours greater than 65534 will be coded as 65534.
; ( 2) The reference time in section 1 and the forecast time together define the beginning of the overall time interval.
; ( 3) An increment of zero means that the statistical processing is the result of a continuous (or near continuous) process, not the processing of a number of discrete samples. Examples of such continuous processes are the temperatures measured by analogue maximum and minimum thermometers or thermographs, and the rainfall measured by a raingauge. The reference and forecast times are successively set to their initial values plus or minus the increment, as defined by the type of time increment (one of octets 51, 63, 75 ...). For all but the innermost (last) time range, the next inner range is then processed using these reference and forecast times as the initial reference and forecast time.

47  numberOfBitsForScaledGroupLengths   unsigned    Number of bits used for the scaled group lengths (after subtraction of the reference value given in octets 38-41 and division by the length increment given in octet 42)
; Notes:
; ( 1) Group lengths have no meaning for row by row packing, where groups are coordinate lines (so the Grid Description Section and possibly the Bit-map Section are enough); for consistency associated field width and reference should then be encoded as 0.
; ( 2) For row by row packing with a bit-map, there should always be as many groups as rows. In case of rows with only missing values, all associated descriptors should be coded as zero.
; ( 3) Management of widths into a reference and increments, together with management of lengths as scaled incremental values, are intended to save descriptor size (which is an issue as far as compression gains are concerned).
; ( 4) Management of explicitly missing values is an alternative to bit-map use within Section 6; it is intended to reduce the whole GRIB message size.
; ( 5) There may be two types of missing value(s), such as to make a distinction between static misses (for instance, due to a land/sea mask) and occasional misses.
; ( 6) As an extra option, substitute value(s) for missing data may be specified. If not wished (or not applicable), all bits should be set to 1 for relevant substitute value(s).
; ( 7) If substitute value(s) are specified, type of content should be consistent with original field values (floating-point - and then IEEE 32-bit encoded-, or integer).
; ( 8) If primary missing values are used, such values are encoded within appropriate group with all bits set to 1 at packed data level.
; ( 9) If secondary missing values are used, such values are encoded within appropriate group with all bits set to 1, except the last one set to 0, at packed data level.
; ( 10) A group containing only missing values (of either type) will be encoded as a constant group (null width, no associated data) and the group reference will have all bits set to 1 for primary type, and all bits set to 1, except the last bit set to 0, for secondary type.
; ( 11) If necessary, group widths and/or field width of group references may be enlarged to avoid ambiguities between missing value indicator(s) and true data.
; ( 12) The group width is the number of bits used for every value in a group.
; ( 13) The group length (L) is the number of values in a group.
; ( 14) The essence of the complex packing method is to subdivide a field of values into NG groups, where the values in each group have similar sizes. In this procedure, it is necessary to retain enough information to recover the group lengths upon decoding. The NG group lengths for any given field can be described by Ln = ref + Kn * len_inc, n = 1,NG, where ref is given by octets 38-41 and len_inc by octet 42. The NG values of K (the scaled group lengths) are stored in the Data Section, each with the number of bits specified by octet 47. Since the last group is a special case which may not be able to be specified by this relationship, the length of the last group is stored in octets 43-46.

; Notes:
; ( 1) Spatial differencing is a pre-processing before group splitting at encoding time. It is intended to reduce the size of sufficiently smooth fields, when combined with a splitting scheme as described in Data Representation Template 5.2. At order 1, an initial field of values f is replaced by a new field of values g, where g1 = f1, g2 = f2 - f1, ..., gn = fn - fn-1. At order 2, the field of values g is itself replaced by a new field of values h, where h1 = f1, h2 = f2, h3 = g3 - g2, ..., hn = gn - gn-1. To keep values positive, the overall minimum of the resulting field (either gmin or hmin) is removed. At decoding time, after bit string unpacking, the original scaled values are recovered by adding the overall minimum and summing up recursively.
; ( 2) For differencing of order n, the first n values in the array that are not missing are set to zero in the packed array. These dummy values are not used in unpacking.

; Notes:
; ( 1) The intent of this template is to scale the grid point data to obtain desired precision, if appropriate, and then subtract out reference value from the scaled field as is done using Data Representation Template 5.0. After this, the resulting grid point field can be treated as a grayscale image and is then encoded into the JPEG 2000 code stream format. To unpack the data field, the JPEG 2000 code stream is decoded back into an image, and the original field is obtained from the image data as described in regulation 92.9.4, Note (4).
; ( 2) The JPEG 2000 standard specifies that the bit-depth must be in the range of 1 to 38 bits.
; ( 3) The compression ratio M:1 ( e.g. 20:1 ) specifies that the encoded stream should be less than ((1/M) x depth x number of data points) bits, where depth is specified in octet 20 and number of data points is specified in octets 6-9 of the Data Representation Section.
; ( 4) The order of the data points should remain as specified in the scanning mode flags (Flag Table 3.4) set in the appropriate Grid Definition Template, even though the JPEG 2000 standard specifies that an image is stored starting at the top left corner. Assuming that the encoding software is expecting the image data in raster order (left to right across rows for each row), users should set the image width to Ni (or Nx) and the height to Nj (or Ny) if bit 3 of the scanning mode flag equals 0 (adjacent points in i (x) order), when encoding the "image". If bit 3 of the scanning mode flags equals 1 (adjacent points in j (y) order), it may be advantageous to set the image width to Nj (or Ny) and the height to Ni (or Nx).
; ( 5) This template should not be used when the data points are not available on a rectangular grid, such as occurs if some data points are bit-mapped out or if section 3 describes a quasi-regular grid. If it is necessary to use this template on such a grid, the data field can be treated as a one dimensional image where the height is set to 1 and the width is set to the total number of data points specified in octets 6-9.
; ( 6) Negative values of E or D shall be represented according to Regulation 92.1.5.

After this, the resulting grid point field can be treated as an image and is then encoded into PNG format. To unpack the data field, the PNG stream is decoded back into an image, and the original field is obtained from the image data as described in regulation 92.9.4, Note (4).
; ( 2) PNG does not support all bit-depths in an image, so it is necessary to define which depths can be used and how they are to be treated. For grayscale images, PNG supports depths of 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 bits. Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color images can have depths of 8 or 16 bits with an optional alpha sample. Valid values for octet 20 can be: 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 - treat as grayscale image 24 - treat as RGB color image (each component having 8 bit depth) 32 - treat as RGB w/ alpha sample color image (each component having 8 bit depth)
; ( 3) The order of the data points should remain as specified in the scanning mode flags (Flag Table 3.4) set in the appropriate Grid Definition Template, even though the PNG standard specifies that an image is stored starting at the top left corner and scans across each row from left to right starting with the top row. Users should set the image width to Ni (or Nx) and the height to Nj (or Ny) if bit 3 of the scanning mode flag equals 0 (adjacent points in i (x) order), when encoding the "image". If bit 3 of the scanning mode flags equals 1 (adjacent points in j (y) order), it may be advantageous to set the image width to Nj (or Ny) and the height to Ni (or Nx).

After this, the resulting grid point field can be treated as a greyscale image and encoded into the CCSDS recommended standard for lossless data compression code stream format. To unpack the data field, the CCSDS recommended standard for lossless data compression code stream is decoded back into an image, and the original field is obtained from the image data as described in regulation 92.9.4, Note 4
; ( 2) The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) recommended standard for lossless data compression is the standard used by space agencies for the compression of scientific data transmitted from satellites and other space instruments. This is a very fast predictive compression algorithm based on the extended-Rice algorithm. It uses Golomb-Rice codes for entropy coding. The sequence of prediction errors is divided into blocks. Each block is compressed using a two-pass algorithm. In the first pass, the best coding method for the whole block is determined. In the second pass, the output of the marker of the selected coding method is encoded as ancillary information along with prediction errors. The coding methods include:
; Golomb-Rice codes of a chosen rank
; Unary code for transformed pairs of prediction errors
; Fixed-length natural binary code if the block is found to be incompressible
; Signalling to the decoder empty block if all prediction errors are zeroes
; ( 3) Library flags governing data type, and storage and processing parameters. For further information, see Rosenhauer, Mathis. "Flags" libaec - Adaptive Entropy Coding library. German Climate Computing Centre (Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum, DKRZ), 12 May 2016. Web. 13 June 2016. Further details
